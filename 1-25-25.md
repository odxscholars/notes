### Virtual Private Clouds
- Term: Cloud Service Provider (**CSP**)
- **Region and Availability Clouds**
	- Within a region, there are availability zones (**AZs**)
		- Example: West Coast and East Coast Regions
		- In the Philippines, we don't have AZs but we have a more simplified version of an AZ called **Local Zones**
	- Is there a difference between AZs and Local Zones?
		- **Availability Zones**: Isolated locations within a region, each with its own power, cooling, and networking, designed for high availability and fault tolerance. Used for distributing workloads across a region to ensure resilience.
		- **Local Zones**: Extensions of a region, placed closer to end users, providing low-latency access to specific services. Ideal for applications requiring single-digit millisecond latency.
