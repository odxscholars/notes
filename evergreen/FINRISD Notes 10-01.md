### What is Risk?

**Definition**:  
- Risk refers to the potential for losses or adverse outcomes arising from uncertainty in decisions or events.
- Risk is generally **not** about expected losses in itself but rather the unexpected
	- Expected losses is more a function of budgeting and pricing models
	- Therefore, risk management is interested in trying to manage the unexpected

#### Key Concept: Possible Losses
- **Keyword**: possible losses
- Refers to potential negative outcomes that could result from various risk factors.

---

#### Example: Loan Pricing Model

- **Visual Reference**:  
  ![[references/Pasted image 20250121092024.png]]  
  *The image illustrates average loan rates by sector alongside potential loss rates.*

- **Explanation**:  
  The average rate for loans (shown in the top table) is higher than the **possible losses** they could incur. This ensures the risk is accounted for and profitability is maintained.
  
  - *Example*:  
    - Corporate banking charges an average rate of **6.56%** to account for a **3.7% loss rate**.
    - This difference is referred to as being *priced in*.

#### Breakdown: Factors Influencing Loan Pricing
Loan pricing incorporates the following key factors to account for risk:
1. **Operational Costs**  
   - Administrative and logistical expenses associated with maintaining loans.
2. **Default Cases**  
   - The likelihood of borrowers failing to repay loans.
3. **Interest Rate Movements**  
   - Variations in market interest rates affecting overall profitability.
4. **Losses from Fraud**  
   - Financial losses due to fraudulent activities.

#### Summary
Risk is an inherent factor in financial decisions, with loan pricing being a practical example of how institutions mitigate potential losses through strategic rate adjustments.

### Is Pricing in Average/Expected Loss Sufficient to Cover Risk?

**Visual Reference**:  
  ![[Pasted image 20250121095313.png]]
*The chart illustrates trends in loan levels, year-over-year growth, and risk indicators (NPL, RL ratios) over time.*
1. **NPL (Non-Performing Loan)**: - A loan in which the borrower has failed to make scheduled payments for an extended period (usually 90 days or more). - Indicates heightened credit risk and can signal financial instability in the borrower or market. 
2. **RL (Restructured Loan)**: - A loan that has been modified from its original terms due to the borrower's financial difficulty. - Modifications may include extending the repayment period, reducing the interest rate, or forgiving part of the loan. - Restructured loans often indicate underlying financial strain but aim to avoid outright defaults.

---

#### Key Observations from the Data:
- **Incremental Losses**:  
  - Losses have risen to levels unseen in the past decade, indicating heightened risk.
  - Even though the impact appears muted compared to the 2008 crisis, the numbers remain significant.

- **Unaccounted Market Behavior**:  
  - The sudden changes in market trends highlight that common models often fail to factor in extreme or unexpected events.
  - Pricing based solely on average or expected loss might not be sufficient to cover such deviations.

---

#### Analysis:
- **Average/Expected Loss Pricing Limitations**:
  - **Static Assumptions**:  
    Pricing models based on averages assume stable conditions and do not fully account for volatile market behavior.
  - **Tail Risk**:  
    Unexpected events (e.g., economic shocks or fraud spikes) can cause losses that far exceed the expected range.

- **Risk Indicators from the Chart**:
  - Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratios and Risk Levels (RL ratios) show clear upward trends in certain periods.
  - These shifts suggest potential risks beyond what is accounted for by standard pricing mechanisms.

---

#### Conclusion:
Relying solely on average/expected loss pricing is insufficient to comprehensively cover risk. Dynamic models that incorporate tail risk and potential volatility are crucial for robust risk management.

### Common Ways by which risk is managed by banks
#### Risk and Return Models (Pricing in)
Banks use models to balance risk and return by pricing products and loans to account for potential losses and operational costs.
#### Capital Adequacy
Balance sheet and risk based computation of economic capital

Ensures sufficient capital reserves to absorb losses, calculated using balance sheet analysis and risk-based economic capital models.
#### Target Risk Profile
Banks establish desired risk exposure levels to align with their strategic objectives, ensuring decisions stay within acceptable risk limits.

### Three general types of risk (Pillar 1 Risks)
#### Credit 
The risk of financial loss due to a borrower's failure to meet contractual obligations (e.g., loan defaults).

Usually the largest in terms of risk
#### Market
The risk of losses arising from unfavorable changes in market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or stock prices.
#### Operational
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events (e.g., fraud, system failures, or natural disasters).

### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
**Visual Reference:** ** ![[Pasted image 20250121101929.png]]
**
**Key Points**:
1. **Integration of Risk and Capital Controls**:  
   - ERM ensures total bank risk is aligned with capital controls, maintaining a balance between risk exposure and capital adequacy.

2. **Mathematical Models**:  
   - Advanced models are used to measure and manage potential risks, allowing for data-driven decision-making and forecasting.

3. **Compliance with Basel III**:  
   - Minimum capital requirements are enforced to manage bank-wide risks effectively, promoting financial stability.
   - Minimum capital requirement of **10%**
	   - TQC should at least be 10% of CRWA, MRWA, ORWA, and Total RWA
