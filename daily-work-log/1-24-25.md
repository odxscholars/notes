### Interest Rate Risk
---
##### Reinvestment RIsk
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Risk from changes in market interest rates affecting assets, liabilities, or income.
- **Reinvestment Risk**: Risk of reduced profits or higher costs due to rate changes on reinvested funds.

##### Scenario
1. **Initial State**:
   - **Assets**: 
     - Loan (Floating) = 100, Interest Rate = 5%
   - **Liabilities + Equity**: 
     - Deposit (Floating) = 50, Interest Rate = 3%
     - Common Stock = 50, Interest Rate = None
2. **Change**: Interest rates rise by 100 basis points (1%).

##### Impact of Rate Increase
- **Assets**: Loan rate increases from 5% to 6% → Higher interest income.
- **Liabilities**: Deposit rate increases from 3% to 4% → Higher interest expense.

##### Implications
- Both income and expense rise, but the impact on profitability depends on the rate margin between assets and liabilities.

Dispatch Latency 
- Conflict occurs when:
	- pre-emption of process in kernel mode
	- Release by low-priority process of resources for high-priority processes
Riot Monotonic Scheduling
- Priority is assigned based **inverse** of its period
- Essentially, the shorter time you need, the higher priority you receive
Earliest Deadline First
- Essentially, the sooner the deadline, The higher priority you get
Proportional Share Scheduling
- T shares are allocated among all the resources within the system
---
**Mutex Locks**
- the problem with previous solutions is that they are **complicated** and generally **inaccessible** to most programmers
- ***Mutually exclusive lock**
- How to use it?
	- If you want to protect a critical section of your code where multiple threads/processes might invoke it,
		- **acquire()** a lock
		- **release()**
	- Calls to acquire and release must be **atomic**
		- What does this mean?
- The **problem** with mutex locks is that it **requires** busy waiting
	- sometimes called a spinlock
---
**Semaphores**
- ILT: There's someone triggering the signal or saying that this specific **critical section** is free
- Is executed by using **wait()** and **signal()**
	- Hence, Semaphores guarantee that no two processes can execute wait and signal commands.
- Busy waiting still exists
**Semapahores with no Busy Waiting**
- Solution: Associated waiting queue for each semaphore
	- Each entry in the WQ has:
		- Integer
		- Pointer
- Two operations:
	- **block** - put process in waiting queue
	- **wakeup** - remove from wq and into rq

---
**Single Resource Allocation**
- Allocate a single resource among competing processes using priority numbers that specifies the maximum time a process plans to use the resource
> **Single resource allocation** is about deciding who gets to use that resource and when, in a way that meets certain goals—like fairness, efficiency, or priority.
 
- Shortest first is allocated
- R is an instance of type *ResourceAllocator*
- where t is the maximum time a process plans to use the resource
---

## Liveness
- Forms of deadlocks:
	- **Starvation** - blocks are indefinite
	- **Priority Inversion** - low priority process holds a lock that are needed by higher-priority process
	- Solved via **priority-inheritance protocol**
	-
