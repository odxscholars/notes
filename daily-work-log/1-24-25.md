### Interest Rate Risk
---
##### Reinvestment RIsk
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Risk from changes in market interest rates affecting assets, liabilities, or income.
- **Reinvestment Risk**: Risk of reduced profits or higher costs due to rate changes on reinvested funds.

##### Scenario
1. **Initial State**:
   - **Assets**: 
     - Loan (Floating) = 100, Interest Rate = 5%
   - **Liabilities + Equity**: 
     - Deposit (Floating) = 50, Interest Rate = 3%
     - Common Stock = 50, Interest Rate = None
2. **Change**: Interest rates rise by 100 basis points (1%).

##### Impact of Rate Increase
- **Assets**: Loan rate increases from 5% to 6% → Higher interest income.
- **Liabilities**: Deposit rate increases from 3% to 4% → Higher interest expense.

##### Implications
- Both income and expense rise, but the impact on profitability depends on the rate margin between assets and liabilities.
