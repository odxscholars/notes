#### Risk Management Process

1. **Identify Risk Exposures**  
   - Examples: Is it market risk, credit risk exposure, etc.  
   - Identify exposures to risks that haven't been identified.

2. **Measure and Estimate Risk Exposures** ^e5ad11  
   - Typically measured using a two-part system:  
     - A ***likelihood*** versus ***severity*** 2-dimensional graph:  
       - **Examples**:  
         - Employees being late (High likelihood, low severity)  
         - Pandemic (Low likelihood, high severity)  
   - Formula for Credit Risk Exposure:  
    $$
\text{Credit Risk Exposure} = \text{Probability of Default} \times (\text{Loss Severity [Exposure - Recoverable Amount]}) \times \text{Exposure at Default}
$$


3. **Assess Effects of Exposures**  
   - Consider interdependencies and correlations between risks instead of viewing risks in isolation.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Lending to Universal Robina Corp and Robinsons Land Corp:  
       - Different companies but part of the same parent owner, resulting in correlated credit risks.  
     - Placements in long-term bonds (market risk exposure):  
       - Affected by interest rate risk, which also impacts credit risk for borrowers like Universal Robina Corp.  
     - Stock price movements of two investments:  
       - If securities move in opposite directions, their risks may offset each other.

4. **Find Instruments and Facilities to Shift or Trade Risks**  
   *(Occurs simultaneously with [Measure and Estimate Risk Exposures](#e5ad11))*  
   - **Transfer Mechanisms**: Use insurance, reinsurance, or credit default swaps.  
   - **Derivatives**: Hedge market risks with tools like options, futures, and swaps.  
   - **Securitization**: Convert assets or risks into tradable securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities).  
   - **Risk-Sharing Partnerships**: Form alliances or joint ventures to distribute risks.  
   - **Diversification**: Reallocate resources or investments to reduce dependency on a single risk source.  

5. **Form a Risk Mitigation Strategy**  
   - **Avoid**:  
     - Completely avoid the risk activity.  
     - Example: Avoid opening a business in Ukraine due to geographical risks.  
   - **Transfer**:  
     - Shift the risk to another entity.  
     - Example: A bank exposed to fire risk can transfer it via fire insurance.  
   - **Mitigate**:  
     - Reduce the exposure or impact of the risk.  
     - Example: In flood-prone areas, build flood-resistant infrastructure and disaster response plans.  
     - **Residual Risk**: The remaining risk after mitigation efforts.  
       - Example: Fire sprinklers reduce fire risk, but some residual risk remains.  
   - **Keep**:  
     - Retain manageable risks or those where mitigation costs outweigh the benefits.  
     - Example: A startup might accept market demand fluctuations as part of its growth strategy.  

6. **Evaluate and Adjust as Needed**  
   - Continuously monitor and refine risk management strategies based on outcomes and new information.

#### Risk Management Framework
---
1. Contains the geenral practice which will dictate how a bank will manage its risk
2. What does a risk management framework usually contain
	- Governance Structure ^d3dce7
		1. **Front-Facing Roles**  
			- Directly interact with stakeholders, clients, or external entities.  
			- Responsible for implementing policies, ensuring compliance, and providing operational feedback to policymakers.  
			- **Examples**: Risk managers, operations teams, customer-facing representatives.
		
		2. **Policy Makers**  
			- Develop, draft, and formalize risk management policies and frameworks.  
			- Analyze risk exposures and set guidelines for acceptable risk thresholds.  
			- Collaborate with front-facing roles to ensure policies are practical and effective.  
			- **Examples**: Board of Directors, Risk Committees, Compliance Officers.
		
		3. **Review and Approve Policies**  
			- Oversight bodies that ensure policies align with organizational goals, regulatory standards, and stakeholder expectations.  
			- Conduct periodic reviews and make amendments to address emerging risks or changes in the operating environment.  
			- Examples: Audit Committees, Executive Leadership Teams, Independent Review Boards.
	- Risk Culture
		- Same as [[#^d3dce7|Governance Structure]] since everyone owns the risk
	- Risk Appetite
		- *How much risk are you willing to take in the organization*
			- Allows you to decide on which strategy to take
	- Risk management architecture
